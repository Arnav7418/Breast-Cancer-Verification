# Breast Cancer Verification and E-Commerce Platform

Welcome to the Breast Cancer Verification and E-Commerce Platform project. This project combines a cutting-edge breast cancer report verification system with an integrated e-commerce platform where users can purchase medications and other related products.

## Project Description

Breast cancer diagnosis is critical, and accuracy is paramount. Unfortunately, studies show that up to 1 in 8 breast cancer reports can contain errors. This project aims to mitigate that risk by allowing users to verify the accuracy of their breast cancer reports. Additionally, the platform offers a seamless way for users to book consultations with doctors and purchase necessary medicines and health products.

### Key Features:

1. **Breast Cancer Report Verification**: Users can upload their breast cancer reports and verify if the reports are accurate.
2. **Doctor Consultations**: Users have the option to book consultations with doctors directly through the platform.
3. **E-Commerce Platform**: The platform includes an e-commerce section where users can buy medicines and other products related to breast cancer care.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: The platform is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, ensuring a smooth user experience.
5. **Secure and Confidential**: All user data is handled with the utmost security and confidentiality, protecting users' privacy.

By offering an integrated platform for verifying breast cancer reports, booking consultations, and purchasing related products, we aim to support breast cancer patients with reliable and accessible resources.
